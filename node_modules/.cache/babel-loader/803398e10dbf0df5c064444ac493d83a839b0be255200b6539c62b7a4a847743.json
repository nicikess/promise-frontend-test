(23:00-27:30).\\\n    After another look at the Variant and Process Explorer, she switches to the Conformance View and starts adapting the to-be BPMN model. [A structured approach or a clear reason for the performed edits is not clear] [The analysis leads to no outcomes /insights about circumstances or root causes] (27:30 - 40:00).\\\n    She filters the process to cases with payment and uses the process overview to look at temporal aspects like the case distribution per month and the throughput time. Based on the case distribution, the analyst is able to identify a circumstance based on peaks in the distribution and ends the analysis (40:00-45:00)\\\"\",\n    analysisExpertise: \"Average\",\n    tool: [\"Celonis\"],\n  },\n\n  //Participant 6\n  {\n    name: \"Participant 6\",\n    pmExpertise: \"Good\",\n    userStory:\"\\\"The participant starts by reading the artifacts aloud (00:00-04:00).  \\\n    After that she reads the guiding question and clarifies some open questions with the interviewer (04:00-06:30) .  \\\n    Then she opens Disco where she starts making sense of the control flow of the process and the involved activities by using the process map. She jumps back and forth between the activity descriptions in the artifacts and the process map. (06:00-13:00).  \\\n    While still using the process map, she starts to hypothesize about potential root causes [not data driven] about certain paths of the process (e.g. payment before fine is send). (13:00-14:00) \\\n    Now she focuses on the control-flow again and considers the frequency of events and the duration between events. She takes notes to capture her findings in between (14:00-18:30). \\\n    She dives deeper into performance related details and notices the temporal constraints within the process. [Even though the noticed the temporal constraints, it seems like she is not sure how to analyse it]. Still using the Process Map, she jumps between checking the performance, the number of events and temporal constraints/activity descriptions based on the provided artifacts. Before setting the filter, she mentioned that she is interested in checking if fines are not paid due to the late notification (18:30-24:00).\\\n    Therefore, she filters the data for a specific path . She uses the case view and observes that the payment still occurs in her selection, which she confirms in the Process Map (24:00-26:30). She switches back to the unfiltered event log where she checks further paths with and without payment and activities which can be followed after “Send Fine” (26:30-29:30). \\\n    [Brief interruption (29:30-33:00)].  \\\n    She decides to use performance metrics instead of frequency metrics to see the minimum and maximum durations [seems to not draw any conclusions based on the information]. She switches back to frequency metrics and changes the level of detail a couple of times [without any notably insights gained?] (33:00 - 37:30).  \\\n    She applies an endpoint filtering (“send fine”). By viewing the cases, she emits an hypothesis for a root cause of fines not being paid [fines are being sent too late because of a resource management problem,  which leads to a lot of fines not being paid] (37:30-45:00).  \\\n    She goes back to the unfiltered log and browses through the process map and explains using absolute frequency how many payments are not performed. She applies different levels of details and checks activities. [Seems like she is trying to come up with a valid hypothesis on activities following the payment, but everything seems a bit random] (45:00:56:00).\\\n    She uses the statistics view to check additional patterns and is interested in the number of events per case. (56:00-59:00).  \\\n    After going back to the process map and considering the flow at the full level of detail, she filters for cases being paid to understand the paths to payment. [Thanks to this step, she is able to understand why the payment activity is redundant in some cases]. (59:00-1:10).  \\\n    She later tries to explain why some cases are being sent to credit collection after payment [Unsuccessfully?] (1:10:00-1:16:30). \\\n     She starts to explain her main findings: (1) in a lot of cases, the fine is being sent very late, resulting in fines not being paid [the amount is unclear] (2) some payments are performed in two or three phases, (3) the system sometimes believes that the payment is not done, sending a message to credit collection [she assumes that it is an external process], while some partial payments do not require the credit collection step . [Connection interrupted] (1:16:30-1:19:30). \\\n    She finally switches to ProM, using the dotted chart to differentiate between activities, and finds that most are being sent to credit collection, which she confirms in Disco by observing the control flow of the process . She tries a similar approach for the payment activity but is stopped by time (1:19:30-1:27:00). \\\"\",\n    analysisExpertise: \"Good\",\n    tool: [\"Disco\"],\n  },\n\n  //Participant 7\n  {\n    name: \"Participant 7\",\n    pmExpertise: \"Advanced\",\n    userStory:\n    \"\\\"The participants carefully reads all information available from in the provided pdf files, i.e. the instruction, all information in the artifacts.

(08:30-11:00)\\\n    Afterwards, he elaborates his tool selection and decides to perform the analysis in Disco. From the Process Map, he follows the different activities and variants and re-checks some of the activity explanations in the artifacts (11:00-20:00). [It seems like the participant is happy with his understanding and was able to generate some hypothesis/ideas on what to check next. These ideas are not explicitly stated.]\\\n    He analyzes the end activities of the process and filters on the most common end activity. After realizing that he is looking at a complicated subset of the event log and decides that also filtering for other end activities might not help him, he switches to the Cases View [because he noticed that the analysis of the end activities is not as promising as expected] (20:00-24:30).\\\n    [Replanning] By analyzing the most common variant, the participant identifies his first finding and interprets this variant [interpretation is not fully based on the data]. He now dives deeper into the different variants and captures his findings for the top 10 variants.

While the selection (split traces) loads, he switches back to Celonis (15:00-16:30).\\\n    The participant is switching between the Dashboards and tries to find filtering options. After expressing the need for filtering on cases without payment, the interviewer helped him and guided him to the process explorer from where he set the filter. With the filter applied, he switches again through the Dashboards, trying to identify any patterns. He checks different cases and attributes [he is not following any hypothesis/structured exploration]. After adding an additional filter for cases ending with send fine, he notices the throughput time and formulates his first insight from the analysis [he noticed the throughput time rather by chance] (16:30-26:30).\\\n    He now wants to dive into more details to analyses the connection between Create Fine - Send Fine. However, while he filters for the connection, he notices that he has missed to consider some other activities (slider in process explorer was at 0%) that he is interested in and focuses on different other activities [gets distracted from his original goal/lost in details] (26:30-29:30).\\\n    Then he wants to check if there are any attributes that could helm him understanding the appeal to judge. He jumps back in the documentation and identifies the dismissal attribute, which he considers as very important. He states that he should have checked the activity and attribute descriptions earlier. He jumps back into Celonis and looks at the dismissal attribute  (29:30-33:00).\\\n    Then he reminds himself about the guiding question and starts summarizing the circumstances he could identify so far. However, [get distracted again ?] he is diving into the dismissal attribute again and tries different filtering options [not successful].
